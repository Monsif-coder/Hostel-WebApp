## Email System Documentation

### Overview
The booking system now includes email notifications to users when they create a booking. The system uses SendGrid as the email delivery service.

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a SendGrid account and obtain an API key
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with: 
   `SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
3. Verify a sender domain or email in SendGrid

### Features
- Email confirmation sent upon successful booking
- Magic link for viewing reservation details
- Sandbox mode for testing without sending real emails
- Detailed error logging and handling

### Testing
- Use `node test-email.js` to test basic email functionality
- Use `node test-booking-endpoint.js` to test the booking flow with email
- Set `sandbox: true` in email parameters to prevent real emails from being sent

### Troubleshooting
- Check server logs for SendGrid API responses
- Verify the API key is properly loaded from environment variables
- Ensure the sender email is properly verified in SendGrid
